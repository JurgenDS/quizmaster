# Setup IntelliJ IDEA

When working in GitHub Codespace, VS Code automatically installs recommended extensions.

## Recommended extensions
Otherwise, install recommended extensions:

- [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
- [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)
- [Cucumber (Gherking) Full Support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexkrechik.cucumberautocomplete)

## Limitations
Couldn't make the following extensions working:

- [Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome), for linting and formatting.
- Any Cucumber runner.

Thus, linting and formatting, and E2E tests must be run from command line.
